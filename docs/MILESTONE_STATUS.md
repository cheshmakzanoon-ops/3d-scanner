# Current status — M10

| Area | Actual state |
|---|---|
| App/capture | Kotlin/Compose/CameraX, local imports, calibration, private project storage |
| Sparse geometry | Shared C++ SfM/PnP, multi-view tracks and joint Schur-complement bundle adjustment; fixed intrinsics |
| Depth/surface | Bounded CPU stereo, reciprocal checks and open indexed triangle patches; not complete manifold reconstruction |
| Photographic UV | Full XYZ cross product and glTF top-left origin repaired; all 3,530 existing triangles textured on one real stereo benchmark |
| Appearance | Bounded, measured exposure gains and deterministic camera-label smoothing; not seamless blending |
| Native validation | Seven CTest targets and 98 Python checks; GCC/Clang strict builds; eight new photometric cases pass ASan/UBSan |
| Android validation | Requires commit-specific Actions build and emulator results; no physical camera proof |
| Preview | Vertex-colored diagnostic view; photographic GLB exports are separate |
| Resource limits | At most 12 sparse photos, three Android depth views at 256px edge, texture sources up to 768px |
| Release status | Engineering prototype only; not consumer/store ready |

The new fixes improve measured material projection without altering mesh geometry
or relaxing visibility gates. 100% benchmark triangle coverage is not whole-object
completeness. See M10_VALIDATION.md for actual numbers and test boundaries.

Historical implementation/validation records are retained in M02–M09 documents.
The full product contract remains PROJECT_PLAN.md; phases requiring physical
handsets, complete-object ground truth and sustained resource measurements remain
open. No synthetic or two-camera stereo test closes those gates.
